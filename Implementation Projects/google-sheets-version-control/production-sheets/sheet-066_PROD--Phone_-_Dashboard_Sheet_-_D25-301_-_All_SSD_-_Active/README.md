## Snapshot Information

This directory contains a read-only snapshot of the Apps Script code attached to this Google Sheet. The snapshot is created using `clasp pull` which downloads code from Google Drive without modifying the source.

### Directory Structure

- `live/` - Current Apps Script code from Google Drive
- `metadata/` - Snapshot metadata (dates, IDs)

### Safety

All snapshots are READ-ONLY operations. The source code in Google Drive is never modified by the snapshot process. This provides:
- Version history
- Backup protection
- Change tracking
- Recovery capability

## Version Control

1. Google Drive (source of truth)
2. Local Git Repository (this snapshot)
3. GitHub Remote
4. Branch Protection Rules
5. Google Cloud Storage (planned)
6. Time Machine
