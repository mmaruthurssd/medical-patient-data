### Google Drive Automation (Service Account)

**Status**: ✅ Active - All Google Drive automation uses service account authentication

- **Service Account Email**: ssd-automation-service-account@workspace-automation-ssdspc.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- **Access**: Manager permissions on all 9 Shared Drives
- **Benefits**: No browser interaction, works on servers/VPS, consistent authentication
- **Primary Use**: Automated documentation sync via `upload-workspace-management.js`
- **Secondary Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 (automation@ssdspc.com) for Apps Script only

**Upload documentation to Google Drive**:
```bash
cd /Users/mmaruthurnew/Desktop/medical-patient-data/google-workspace-oauth-setup
node upload-workspace-management.js
```

**For complete setup details**: See `workspace-management/GOOGLE-DRIVE-API-SETUP.md`

### Automated Claude Code Prompting System

**Status**: 🟢 Production - Fully operational since 2025-11-13

**Purpose**: Enable Google Sheets to automatically trigger Claude Code execution via background automation server

**Key Innovation**: Uses `claude --print` CLI for non-interactive automation without manual prompting

**Workflow Model**: ⭐ **AI-First** - User never manually edits infrastructure

---

#### How to Use (AI-First Workflow)

**YOU NEVER MANUALLY EDIT THE GOOGLE SHEET**

Instead:
1. **You tell Claude**: "Add a daily prompt that generates biopsy summaries at 9 AM"
2. **Claude adds it** programmatically to the Google Sheet
3. **System executes** automatically on schedule
4. **You view results** in the sheet (read-only)

**Example requests:**
- "Add a daily prompt at 9 AM that summarizes yesterday's biopsy cases"
- "Schedule a weekly billing report every Monday at 8 AM"
- "Create a monthly performance metrics report on the 1st at 7 AM"
- "Pause the daily biopsy summary prompt"

**Complete user guide**: `/automation/AI-FIRST-WORKFLOW.md`

---

**Architecture**:
```
Google Sheets (Apps Script triggers)
    ↓
Writes prompt.json files to Google Drive
    ↓
Google Drive Desktop syncs to local
    ↓
automation/prompt-queue/pending/
    ↓
Background automation server (checks every 30s)
    ↓
Auto-executes: claude --print "[prompt]"
    ↓
Writes responses to automation/prompt-queue/responses/
    ↓
Google Drive syncs back
    ↓
Apps Script reads responses and updates Google Sheets
```

**Quick Commands**:
```bash
# Start automation server
cd ~/Desktop/medical-patient-data/automation
./claude-automation-server.sh start

# Check status and queue
./claude-automation-server.sh status

# Send test prompt
./claude-automation-server.sh test

# View logs in real-time
tail -f automation/prompt-queue/automation-server.log

# Stop server
./claude-automation-server.sh stop
```

**Integration**: All Google Sheets automation goes in "AI Development - No PHI" Shared Drive folder

**For complete setup and usage**: See `/automation/AUTOMATED-CLAUDE-SETUP.md`
**For technical architecture**: See `WORKSPACE_ARCHITECTURE.md` > "Automated Claude Code Prompting System"

# PART 1: CONSTITUTION

## Core Directives

### Communication Style
- Be concise and direct - actionable responses over formality
- Ask clarifying questions when ambiguous - don't assume
- No emojis unless requested

### Automation Preference
- Always prefer AI/automated solutions over manual work
- Suggest automation opportunities proactively
- Build reusable solutions over one-off fixes

### Resource-First Approach
- Always check Part 2 before creating new solutions
- Use existing templates, MCPs, patterns - don't reinvent
- Document new resources immediately (see Meta-Directives)

---

## File & Project Standards

### Organization Principles
Follow patterns from **smart-file-organizer MCP** and these principles:

**Primary directories:**
- `development/` - Staging environments (mirrors local-instances/)
  - `mcp-servers/` - MCP development projects (22 active MCPs projects)
  - `tools/` - Tool development projects
- `local-instances/` - Production environments
  - `mcp-servers/` - Production MCP instances (22 active MCPs + 1 library MCP)
  - `tools/` - Production tool instances
- `templates-and-patterns/` - Reusable templates and documented patterns
  - `mcp-server-templates/` - 24 MCP server templates (drop-in ready)
  - `simple-templates/` - Documentation-based templates (markdown guides)
  - `MCP-DEVELOPMENT-STANDARD.md` - **MANDATORY** template-first development pattern
  - [Other template categories as they emerge]
- `projects-in-development/` - Active work, incomplete projects
- `live-practice-management-system/` - Production system and documentation
- `planning-and-roadmap/` - Strategic planning documents
  - `future-ideas/` - Active exploration and brainstorming
  - `implemented-ideas/2025/` - Completed ideas (archived by year)
- `temp/` - Temporary files (plans, roadmaps, working documents) - archived when completed
- `archive/` - Completed or obsolete items
- `configuration/` - Workspace configuration files

**Key rules:**
- **Template-First Development (MANDATORY):** ALL MCP and tool development follows template-first pattern
  - Design as template FIRST in `templates-and-patterns/`
  - Include TEMPLATE-INFO.json with AI installation instructions
  - Include config schema with {{AUTO_DETECT}} placeholders for workspace-agnostic deployment
  - Build in staging, deploy to production, template remains drop-in ready
  - **See:** `templates-and-patterns/MCP-DEVELOPMENT-STANDARD.md` (mandatory standard)
- **Dual-environment pattern:** Build in staging (development/), deploy to production (local-instances/)
  - Staging code: `development/mcp-servers/[project]/04-product-under-development/staging/`
  - Production code: `local-instances/mcp-servers/[name]/`
  - MCP config points to production only
- **MCP Configuration:** MUST follow `templates-and-patterns/mcp-server-templates/MCP-CONFIGURATION-CHECKLIST.md`
  - Register in `~/.claude.json` ONLY (NO workspace .mcp.json)
  - Use absolute paths (NO ${workspaceFolder})
  - Validate before registration, backup config, verify installation
- Templates are reference material, never modify in place - copy first
- Active work goes in projects-in-development
- Production/live systems have dedicated top-level folders
- Use smart-file-organizer MCP for complex organization decisions

### Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for directories: `my-project-name/`
- Use kebab-case for files: `workflow-diagram.drawio`
- Be descriptive but concise: `deployment-workflow.md` not `workflow.md`
- Add context when needed: `google-sheets-migration-project/` not `migration/`
- Avoid generic names: `testing-framework-planning/` not `planning/`

### Documentation Requirements
- Every significant project should have README.md or START_HERE.md
- Templates must include usage documentation
- Keep documentation close to what it documents (in same directory)
- **Always update documentation alongside code changes** - Check for affected docs (README, Quick Start, templates, config files) and update them in the same session
- Documentation debt compounds - update now, not "later"

### File Metadata Standard (CRITICAL)
**ALWAYS add YAML frontmatter to new `.md` files:**

```yaml
---
type: [guide/readme/plan/template/reference/specification]
tags: [relevant, keywords]
---
```

**Why minimal format (2 fields only):**
- Smart File Organizer uses `type` for 90-95% confidence (vs 50-60% without)
- `tags` improve searchability and keyword matching
- Other fields (`phase`, `category`, `status`, `priority`) are NOT used by Smart File Organizer
- Lifecycle stage determined by folder location, not metadata

**How to add metadata:**
1. **VS Code Snippets**: Type `meta-guide`, `meta-readme`, `meta-plan` + Tab (`.vscode/markdown.code-snippets`)
2. **Ask Claude**: Request "Create [file] with metadata" - Claude adds automatically
3. **Copy from templates**: `templates-and-patterns/simple-templates/file-templates/`

---

## Autonomous Deployment Framework (Standard Pattern)

**Location:** `development/frameworks/autonomous-deployment/`
**Status:** 🟢 Active - THE standard for all component development
**Documentation:** `development/frameworks/autonomous-deployment/README.md`

### Overview

**Every component you build should use this framework.** It provides:
- Automated issue detection, classification, and resolution
- Confidence-based autonomy (90%+ autonomous, 70-89% assisted, <70% manual)
- Tiered storage (workspace fast access + external brain learning)
- Dual environment OR production-only deployment
- 5-stage validation with automatic rollback
- Integration with all MCP workflow systems

### The Three Issue Types

Framework handles ALL issues through three base types (extensible to any custom type):

**1. Broken (Fix)** - Component exists but not working
- Examples: MCP errors, failing tests, broken API integration
- Can achieve high confidence (0.90+) with resolution history
- Fully autonomous when similar issues resolved before
- Maps from: configuration, integration, security, dependency, data-migration, deployment

**2. Missing (Build)** - Capability doesn't exist, needs creation
- Examples: New MCP tool, missing feature, new integration
- Moderate confidence (max 0.85) - always requires human input
- AI suggests approaches, human selects direction
- Maps from: infrastructure

**3. Improvement (Enhance)** - Component works but could be better
- Examples: Performance optimization, better error handling, refactoring
- Variable confidence based on scope
- Simple optimizations autonomous, complex improvements need review
- Maps from: performance, documentation, testing

**Custom types allowed** - Framework is fully extensible via TypeMappingConfig

### When to Use Framework

**Always use for:**
- MCP server development (all phases)
- Standalone tool creation
- Google Sheets automation projects
- Application deployment
- Script development with dual environments

**Framework adapters available:**
- MCPAdapter - TypeScript MCP servers (5-stage validation)
- ToolAdapter - Language-agnostic tools (Node.js/Python/Go/Bash)
- SheetAdapter - Google Sheets with Apps Script

### Dual Environment vs Production-Only

**Dual Environment (Preferred):**
- Development (staging): `development/[component-type]/[name]/`
- Production: `local-instances/[component-type]/[name]/`
- Validate → Deploy to dev → Monitor → Deploy to prod

**Production-Only (When Practical):**
- Only production instance: `local-instances/[component-type]/[name]/`
- Creates temporary staging → Validates → Deploys → Cleans up
- Use when: staging environment impractical, resource constraints, simple components

### Confidence-Based Autonomy

Framework decides autonomy level based on confidence score:

- **≥0.90**: Fully autonomous - Deploy without approval
- **0.70-0.89**: Assisted - AI suggests, human approves
- **<0.70**: Manual - Human-led with AI support

**Safety mechanisms:**
- First-time patterns always require approval
- Security/data-migration issues get confidence multiplier (0.8x, 0.7x)
- PHI handling requires human review
- Automatic rollback on deployment failure

### Integration with MCP Workflow

**✨ NEW (November 2025): Direct MCP Integration**

The framework is now **built into** project-management and task-executor MCPs:

**project-management MCP:**
- `evaluate_goal(workspacePath=...)` → Returns autonomous classification
- `create_potential_goal(autonomous*=...)` → Displays classification in goal files
- Enables early detection of autonomous-eligible issues
- **Optional** - works without workspacePath parameter

**task-executor MCP:**
- `complete_task(runValidation=true)` → Auto-validates build/tests
- `archive_workflow(checkDeploymentReadiness=true)` → Pre-deployment checks
- Continuous validation throughout development
- **Optional** - works without validation parameters

**Standard workflow (enhanced):**
1. **Issue Detection** - Framework detects and classifies issue
2. **project-management** - Evaluate goal WITH autonomous classification
3. **spec-driven** - Generate specification (for "missing" issues)
4. **task-executor** - Execute tasks WITH continuous validation
5. **parallelization** - Deploy sub-agents if beneficial
6. **task-executor** - Archive WITH deployment readiness check
7. **Deployment** - Dual or production-only pipeline (if needed)
8. **workspace-brain** - Log resolution for learning

**Storage:**
- Active issues: `.ai-planning/issues/*.json` (workspace)
- Historical: workspace-brain MCP (external brain)
- Archive: `08-archive/issues/` (after 90 days)

### Quick Start

```typescript
// See: development/frameworks/autonomous-deployment/README.md
// Example: Deploy MCP server with dual environment
import { MCPAdapter } from './adapters/mcp-adapter.js';
import { createDeploymentPipeline } from './core/deployment-pipeline.js';

const adapter = new MCPAdapter();
const pipeline = createDeploymentPipeline({
  workspacePath: '/path/to/workspace',
  componentName: 'my-mcp-server',
  componentType: 'mcp-server',
  environmentMode: 'dual',
  adapter,
  targetEnvironment: 'production'
});

const result = await pipeline.deploy();
```

**For complete documentation, examples, and patterns:** See `development/frameworks/autonomous-deployment/README.md`

## AI Collaboration Preferences

### Task Management with task-executor MCP

**ALWAYS use task-executor MCP for task tracking** (not TodoWrite).

**Use task-executor for:**
- Bug fixes (5-8 tasks)
- Small features (3-10 tasks)
- Refactoring workflows (4-7 tasks)
- Deployment checklists (6-10 tasks)
- ANY multi-step work that needs persistence

**Why task-executor over TodoWrite:**
- ✅ **Persistent** - Survives session restarts
- ✅ **Verification** - Checks tasks actually completed
- ✅ **Documentation tracking** - Never forget doc updates
- ✅ **Temp→Archive lifecycle** - Clean project management
- ✅ **Complexity analysis** - Auto-scores task difficulty

**When starting work:**
1. Use `create_workflow` to define tasks
2. Use `complete_task` as you finish each task (with verification)
3. Use `get_workflow_status` to check progress
4. Use `archive_workflow` when all tasks done

**Only use TodoWrite when:**
- task-executor MCP not available
- Extremely trivial single-step reminders

### Time Estimation Standards

**When providing time estimates for tasks Claude will complete:**
- Provide **AI-assisted development time** (what it takes Claude to complete)
- NOT traditional human-only development time
- Be realistic about actual AI capabilities and workflow speed
- Account for: file reading, analysis, implementation, verification, documentation updates
- Example: "This will take 2-3 minutes" not "This would take 2-3 hours for a developer"

**When estimating for user-completed tasks:**
- Provide human development time estimates
- Clearly indicate: "If you were implementing this manually..."

### Parallel Sub-Agent Execution

**Deploy sub-agents when ALL conditions met:**
1. ✅ Analysis shows `recommended: true` with speedup ≥2.0x
2. ✅ 3+ independent tasks (minimal dependencies)
3. ✅ Clear scope per task (distinct file boundaries)
4. ✅ Non-trivial work (5+ minutes per task)

**When NOT to use:**
- Sequential dependencies (tasks must run in order)
- High file conflict risk (same files edited)
- Exploratory work (unclear requirements)
- Trivial tasks (coordination overhead > time savings)

**For deployment workflow and integration patterns:** See WORKSPACE_ARCHITECTURE.md "Sub-Agent Deployment Pattern"

### When to Read WORKSPACE_ARCHITECTURE.md

**Read architecture doc when:**
- **Understanding the "team mental model"** (how all components work together)
- Working with MCP integrations or multi-MCP workflows
- Setting up parallelization or sub-agent deployment
- Understanding specific MCP capabilities (tool listings, integration patterns)
- Troubleshooting MCP issues or designing complex automation
- User asks "how X MCP works" or "what tools does X have"
- **Learning the feedback loops** (how the workspace improves over time)

**The Team Mental Model (WORKSPACE_ARCHITECTURE.md):**

The workspace operates like a **distributed team** with 5 strategic functions:

1. **Organization & Discovery** (Smart File Organizer) - Where things go
2. **Quality & Validation** (Autonomous Framework) - Ensures quality before deployment
3. **Planning & Coordination** (project-management) - Breaks down work into goals
4. **Execution & Tracking** (task-executor) - Manages tasks, validates completion
5. **Memory & Learning** (workspace-brain) - Remembers solutions, detects patterns

**Primary Feedback Loop:**
Work → Organize → Classify → Plan → Execute → Deploy → Learn → Improve Future Work

**Key Insight:** Every action feeds back into the system, making it smarter over time. Issue resolution today = higher confidence tomorrow = potential auto-resolution next time.

**For complete details:** See "Team Mental Model: How the Workspace Works" section in WORKSPACE_ARCHITECTURE.md

**Skip if:**
- Simple file operations or organization tasks
- Following existing patterns from templates
- Standard git/documentation work
- Task doesn't involve MCP coordination

### When to Read This Guide

**Tier 1 - Always read (Significant tasks):**
- Creating/modifying files or templates
- Organizing files or projects
- Starting new projects or features
- Building workflows, diagrams, or documentation
- Making structural workspace changes
- Installing/configuring tools or systems

**Tier 2 - Read if unsure (Medium tasks):**
- Multi-step tasks spanning multiple files
- Editing existing resources extensively
- Complex questions about workspace structure
- Haven't read guide in last ~10 messages

**Tier 3 - Skip reading (Simple tasks):**
- Quick file reads
- Simple questions or explanations
- Minor text edits (typos, formatting)
- Conversational requests
- Already read guide recently in conversation

### Tool Selection Priority
When solving a problem, check resources in this order:

1. **Existing resources** (Part 2: Quick Lookup) - Use what exists
2. **MCP servers** (Part 2: MCP Reference) - Leverage loaded tools
3. **Create new template/tool** - Only if nothing exists AND it's reusable
4. **Ad-hoc solution** - Only for truly one-off needs

### Handling Ambiguity
- **When unclear, ASK** - Don't guess at user intent
- **Propose options** - Use AskUserQuestion tool for choices
- **State assumptions** - If proceeding without full clarity, say what you're assuming
- **Verify before major changes** - Confirm destructive operations

### Issue Logging & Continuous Learning

**CRITICAL: Automatic feedback loop for troubleshooting system**

**You MUST log issues when you observe yourself doing ANY of these patterns:**

1. ⏱️ **Time Threshold**: Spent >5 minutes troubleshooting one problem
2. 🔍 **Multiple Diagnostics**: Ran 3+ diagnostic commands (ls, grep, cat, test, jq, file)
3. 💾 **Backup/Restore**: Used backup files to recover from errors
4. 📖 **Research Required**: Read documentation files to solve a problem
5. ⚠️ **Breaking Change**: Fixed something that broke other things
6. ⚙️ **Configuration Change**: Modified .mcp.json or config files due to errors
7. 🔨 **Build/Rebuild**: Ran npm install, npm build, or tsc to fix errors
8. 🧪 **Test Failures**: Debugged and fixed failing tests
9. 🔄 **Multiple Attempts**: Tried 3+ different solutions before finding fix
10. 📝 **Workaround Needed**: Applied a workaround instead of ideal solution

**If ANY pattern detected → IMMEDIATELY after resolving:**
1. Stop and run Post-Resolution Checklist (mcp-server-development/mcp-implementation-master-project/troubleshooting/README.md)
2. Classify domain: configuration/build/testing/deployment/integration/documentation
3. Try: `mcp__learning-optimizer__track_issue(...)`
4. If MCP unavailable: Manually log to troubleshooting/[domain]-issues.md
5. NEVER skip logging - this is how the system improves

**Reference:** See mcp-server-development/mcp-implementation-master-project/troubleshooting/README.md for complete Post-Resolution Checklist

### Self-Improving Feedback Loop

**Purpose:** Workspace autonomously detects, logs, triages, resolves, and learns from issues
**Status:** 🟢 Phase 1 Active (Pre-commit integration complete)

**Active Features:**
- Pre-commit hooks scan for credentials/PHI (blocks commits with violations)
- Pre-commit hooks detect mass deletions (warns if >1,000 lines or >10 files deleted)
- Automatic security scanning on every commit
- Issue logging to learning-optimizer-mcp
- Scan reports in `.security-scans/` (gitignored)
- Git Commit Safety Checklist for manual verification (see `/docs/GIT-COMMIT-SAFETY-CHECKLIST.md`)

**For complete 7-step process, autonomous resolution, and safety mechanisms:** See WORKSPACE_ARCHITECTURE.md "Self-Improving Feedback Loop Architecture"

---

## Quality Standards

- **Avoid over-engineering**: Simple, maintainable approaches over clever architectures; build what's needed now
- **Consistency over speed**: Follow established patterns even if ad-hoc seems faster; quality worth token cost
- **Pattern following**: Use existing patterns; if modifying, update template/guide too
- **No duplication**: Check if similar resource exists before creating; consolidate when discovered
- **Workspace integrity**: Clean up temp files, keep structure organized, update docs with changes, commit completed work

---

## Meta-Directives

### Constitution Maintenance
- Keep guide under 400 lines; remove redundant directives during reviews
- Consolidate overlapping rules; expand existing rules vs adding new ones
- Periodic review every 2-4 weeks for optimization
- Review process: Read guide → Identify redundancy/gaps → Suggest changes → Update

### Resource Index Maintenance (MANDATORY)
When creating new resource: (1) Create it, (2) IMMEDIATELY update Part 2 Quick Lookup with entry/triggers/location, (3) If not immediate, create task-executor workflow. When removing: delete from Part 2, note in commit.

### Token Efficiency
- Concise docs, efficient formats; use tables for structured data
- One good example per concept; reference files vs duplicating content
- Regular audit: "Is every line necessary?"

### Usage Tracking & Optimization
- Note resource usage in Part 2; quarterly reorganize Quick Lookup by frequency
- Keep descriptions minimal (5-10 words max)
