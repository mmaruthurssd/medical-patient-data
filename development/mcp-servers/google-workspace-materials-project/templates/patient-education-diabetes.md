## What is Diabetes?

Diabetes is a condition where your body has trouble using sugar (glucose) from food for energy. When you eat, your body breaks down food into sugar. Normally, a hormone called insulin helps move this sugar from your blood into your cells.

With diabetes, either:
- Your body doesn't make enough insulin (Type 1)
- Your body can't use insulin properly (Type 2)

This causes sugar to build up in your blood instead of going into your cells.
